# SpaceTraders iOS App (Practice Project)

This project is an experimental iOS application that interacts with the [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io/). The goal is to create a simple interface for playing Space Traders on iOS using Swift and SwiftUI.

> **Note:** This app is being developed purely for learning purposes. It is not intended for public release or commercial use.

Through this project, I aim to apply and deepen my knowledge of:
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- API integration
- State management in iOS apps

Feel free to explore or fork the project if you're also learning iOS development or interested in working with the SpaceTraders API.
